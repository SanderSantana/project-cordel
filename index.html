            I feel at ease when I'm with you. <br>
            When in your presence: <br>
            my problems evaporate, <br>
            your thoughts condense like little water droplets in my mind, <br>
            I feel whole.
        </p>

        <p>
            Why do you keep blessing the wicked man? <br>
            Why do you love the crafty man? <br>
            Why do you protect the unrighteous man? <br>
            Whose heart isn't clean and whose tongue has not control off.
        </p>

    <section class="stanza3">
        <p>
            Please don't throw me out  <br>
            Please don't get rid of me <br>
            If you do, <br>
            I'll be like those whose heart feeds on wickedness <br>
            and whose mind is consumed with evil.
        </p>

    <section class="stanza4">
            <p>
            Yes: my heart leans on wickedness too, <br>
            but don't let me be like them. <br>
            Let me look more like those who walk on the narrow path.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those who delight in hardships and adversities. <br>
                Those who pay bad with good and wrap their actions with courtesy. <br>
                Those who proclaim your name without fear and trust.
            </p>

        <p>
            Let me be your child. <br>
            Let me be your servant. <br>
            Let me be your worshiper. <br>
            I want to be a Christian.
